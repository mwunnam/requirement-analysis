# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This is a Repository for leaning purposes. This is about a project on the Requirement Analysis which is focusing on a comprehensive software development by documenting, analyzing and structuring requirements. This is for booking management system

## What is Requirement Analysis?
This is a paramount stage in the development of a software application or website. It entails gathering, analyzing and defining what is needed to develop the product at hand. All stakeholders come on board to make sure there is a clear understanding as to how the software product should perform and the features it must have.
This process or stage in the SDLC brings clarity and understanding. The scope of the project is clearly defined so there is no confusion. Again, with this document, you can estimate the cost and time required to finish the product, and finally, the quality of the product is assured.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Scope Definition: This is very important to guide the process of development so that everyone knows exactly what will be included and what will not be included in the development.
2. Basis of the Design and Development: There is a solid blueprint for the design of the product, and this brings clarity.
3. Cost and Time Estimation: Allocation of time and resources is easy if a good Requirement Analysis is done.
4. Clarity and understanding: This brings clarity and understanding to all stakeholders, which goes a long way towards helping the product meet the acceptance criteria.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
* Requirement Gathering: This has to do with getting all the information needed about the product in question. Information is gathered through interviews, surveys, observation, and document analysis.

* Requirement Elicitation: This is where brainstorming is done with the information gathered to generate ideas. Focus groups may come into play in this stage, prototyping is also done here, involving all or key stakeholders.

* Requirement Documentation: This stage entails creating a detailed document which contains both functional and non-functional requirements. User stories are also captured here describing how users use various functions or features. Use cases are also captured here to show interactions between users and the system.

* Requirement Analysis and Modeling: At this stage, there is prioritization of requirements based on their importance and impact on the overall product. Modeling is done here, flow diagrams and entity-relationship diagrams are drawn to have a visual representation of the requirements.

* Requirement Validation: Reviews and approvals are done by stakeholders. Acceptance criteria are defined to ensure the quality of the product. Traceability metrics are put in place to make sure that all requirements are considered during development and testing.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
This type of Requirement describes what the system should do.
Examples:
* Security          : There should be user authentication.
* Booking Services  : Users should be able to book. 
* Search Propers    : Users should be able to search for properties with their prefrence.
### Non-Functional Requirements 
This type of Requirement describes how the system should perform. 
Examples:
* Performance       : The system should be fast in bringing up search responses.
* Scalability       : The system should be built in a way that it can be scaled up or down  depending on the current situation.
* Reliability       : The system should be up and running always, and if there is a glitch, the recovery time should be fast.   

## Use Case Diagrams
These diagrams contain a visual representation of how users interact with the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria are conditions that must be met for a feature to be accepted by the stakeholders. When such conditions are clearly stipulated, objectives are set straight and there is no confusion. 
Example: When a user use the Checkout button, there should be a confirmatory message showing them the summary of their booking, and if they comfirm it, a payment page should show up.
